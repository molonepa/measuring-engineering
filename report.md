## Introduction

### What is software engineering?

In order to explore how the software engineering process can be measured, we must first ask the question: *what is software engineering*?
The Instituteof Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) defines software engineering as "the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software."[1]
Software engineering is of enormous importance in the modern world as, although software itself is intangible, it is embedded in the hardware of the machies used in various industries and its malfunction can have tangible from, from inconsequential to loss of personal and financial information or even loss of life. Thus the discipline of software engineering is hugely important in ensuring that systems are functional before they lead to costly or disastrous consequences.

### History of software engineering
The person accredited with having first coined the term *software engineering* on the 1960s is Margaret Hamilton, a mathematician and computer science pioneer, and CEO of Hamilton Technologies. According to her, she "fought to bring the software legitimacy so that it - and those building it - would be given due respect and thus [she] began to use the term 'software engineering' to distinguish it from hardware and other types of engineering, yet treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process."[2]
The early days of software engineering was like navigating a wilderness. No one really knew what they were doing and there was no 'knowledge-base' to refer to, but rather information was passed down from person to person. Its importance didn't become apparent until Hamilton joined the Apollo program in 1965.
Software development in the Apollo program was very structured, but very reliable, "Not only did the software itself have to be ultra-reliable, it needed to be able to perform error detection and recovery in real time."[2] Software was programmed on IBM punch cards, which had 80 columns and were 'assembled' to instruction binary on mainframes, which could take hours, thus during missions, most of the software couldn't be changed, as it was encoded into the hardware like ROM. Some engineers would even "[guess] and make up minor changes to the software to work around [hypothetical] failures that were thrown at the flight control team during simulations."[3]
The NASA engineers of the Apollo program made extraordinary accomplishments with the relatively primitive hardware and software available to them, and thanks to the rigorous design methods set out by Hamilton, they knew each line of code so well that they were able to read out binary settings to the astronauts of by radio. This was essential when, during the Apollo 11 mission, several warning lights and computer overload alarms came on as the craft was descending onto the moon's surface. John Garman's, an engineer, pre-flight simulation experience told him that the alarms were not critical and the landing could continue. If not for him the mission would have been aborted and the astronauts would have remained in orbit around the moon.
